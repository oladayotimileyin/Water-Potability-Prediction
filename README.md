# Water-Potability-Prediction

*Water is the most important resource for life, essential for the survival of most existing creatures and humans. Living organisms require sufficient quality water to survive. There are some pollution levels that water species can tolerate. Exceeding these restrictions has an impact on these organisms' existence and risks their life.*

*Access to clean drinking water is critical to health, a basic human right, and a component of any health-protection strategy.*

*This Projects therefore is to predict if water is potable based on some water qualty parameters*

**Methodology**

1. Pandas was used to read in the data and do data cleaning
2. Seaborn was used for Exploratory Data Analysis and to visualize the correlation between dependent and independent variables
3. Support Vector Machine, KNN, Logistic regression, and DecisionTree were the model used
4. GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter Tuning
5. The best performing model is SVM
