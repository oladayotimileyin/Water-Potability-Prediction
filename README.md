# Water-Potability-Prediction

*Water is the most important resource for life, essential for the survival of most existing creatures and humans. Living organisms require sufficient quality water to survive. There are some pollution levels that water species can tolerate. Exceeding these restrictions has an impact on these organisms' existence and risks their life.*

*Access to clean drinking water is critical to health, a basic human right, and a component of any health-protection strategy.*

*This Projects therefore is to predict if water is potable based on some water qualty parameters*
